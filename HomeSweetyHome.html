<p><br/>Hello. I'm Ariane Mariz R. Dulay.Second Year College taking the Bachelor in Science of Information and Technology, at Saint Louis College, City of San Fernando, La Union.

 I really enjoy reading Wattpad stories because it give more inspiration in life and it also help me to escape my problem from the reality. I started reading Wattpad since I was 7th Grade. I can also say that it motivates me to achieve my dreams. Some stories have lots of problems in life but they don't stop, they continue faighting for their dreams. So as a reader of their story it surely motivate other people to be like their main charater. Don't stop until you achieve all your dreams in life.</p>
